### Description

This program is part of an Electronic Medical Records (EMR) application that I have been working on for years. It is not certified by Medicare and therefore will NOT allow one to obtain bonuses. I am a retired physician and I use this personally for my volunteer work. Rx Writer allows one to generate standard prescriptions. It is designed to make prescribing effortless for the doctor and even allows one to completely hand write the Rx or more accurately scribble it. The idea, though, is to reduce medical errors by making things legible. A Help file is included.
